# Current state of the repo:
- The tag `stand-alone-light-malfunction-challenge` is the state of the repo with a working plugin to simulate the lighting challenge in ARIAC world.
- After this I tried triggering the challenge using a ROS2 service. But there is a (possibly silly) compile-time bug which prevented me from completing the same. I think all the logical parts needed are present.
- Attaching the screenshot

# Note:
- `./how_to_run.md` details a few modifiable parameters to control the aspects of the challenge.
